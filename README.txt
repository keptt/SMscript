--SMscript version 1.1

What for:
SMscript is created to automataize your mailing routine. It's made exclusively for sending out emails weather
for work related or your own shady purposes

How to use:
To send your emails using that script open smconfig.txt change its contents into respective blocks (blocks starts 
with "-" or "--" and have their names capitalized) as described inside (do not forget to delete comments inside 
that file which starts and ends with "<<" and ">>"). Then run SMscript.py (of course you need a python compiler 
to do it) and you are good.

Note:
If you are using google free smtp server - "smtp.gmail.com" or other servers like this one, you should consider 
lowering your security settings in your google (gmail) or whatever other email service account you have 
(enable sending emails from less secure apps). In case of gmail you can do this as described here:
